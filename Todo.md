### TODO

- Command line to fetch, validate and store data
- Persist the data into an efficient and optimised database schema
- Frontend interface to display all data in the following order:
    - Aggregate all data points per unit, metric and hour
    - Calculate the “mean“, “minimum“, “maximum“, and “median“ as well as “sample size“ for every hour (01 to 24)
